# FAQ

### Is Flarum Stable?

Yes! After 6 years of development, Flarum 1.0.0 was finally released in 2021. You can find more information about the most up-to-date versions of Flarum in the [community](https://discuss.flarum.org/t/meta).

### What's next after stable?

A formal [Flarum roadmap](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/29931-the-future-of-flarum-a-roadmap) is available on the discussion board. We have a lot of plans and ideas, and look forward to sharing more milestones with the community.

### Can I donate money to speed up development?

All donations are gratefully received. You can give on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/flarum) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/flarum).

However, donations will not directly impact the speed of development on Flarum. We also encourage users to contribute in other ways, such as [contributing code](contributing.md), [building extensions](/extend/README.md), writing documentation, translating Flarum into other languages, providing help and support on the [community forums](https://discuss.flarum.org/)... and just being a general positive energy around the community!

### Will Flarum have [insert feature here]? When? Why not?

We would love to build countless features and extensions for Flarum, but first things first: Our focus is on the essentials and stability.

### Why haven’t you fixed [insert issue here] yet?

Here again, the answer is “first things first”. If we haven’t fixed an issue (or assigned it a milestone) yet, it’s because we’re working on something else that’s just as important. Please be patient; we’ll try to get it done before release. Or if you’re in a hurry, feel free to fix it yourself and [contribute to the project](contributing.md)!

### Will I be able to migrate my forum to Flarum?

We don't currently provide official migrators, but there are many community solutions out there. Relatively soon, we’ll start building tools to import data from other forum software like esoTalk, FluxBB, phpBB, Discourse, and others.

### How do I join the Flarum team?

The real answer is that we generally keep an eye on our community for stand-out members who would make good staff. Honestly, for most of our current staff, what they did before becoming staff wasn't much different from what they do now.

Find a passion and contribute however you feel is best. Then let it take its course. You don't have to have a badge to be respected here.
