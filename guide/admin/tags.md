## User Handbook
### Creating, editing and deleting Tags

Managing your forum tags requires you to be in the Administrator Control Panel, you can do this by clicking your username to the top right of your screen, and then clicking **Administration**. The example below will show you how this is done:

### Creating a new Tag

A tag is a way of categorising posts made by a user, they are primarily set by the staff of the forum (admins).

On the configuration page for **Tags** you'll need to click **Create Tag** which will bring up the create tag box:

### Create Tag Components

#### Name:

The name is what you'd like the tag to be called, also known as the category title.

#### Slug:

The slug is a string that goes into the URL, essentially it's a version of the name of the tag that is all lower-case, and uses dashes instead of spaces.

Unless you need to, you generally don't need to do anything with this, as when you type in the **Name** the slug auto-fills in.

#### Description:

The description of the tag will appear alongside the **name** in the tag selection post when making a post, it's a short few words giving a more in-depth description of the category it belongs to.

#### Colour:

This is the colour you would like the tag to appear in on the posts, and forums, the colour box uses **HTML Colour Codes** beginning with a **#** you can Google around for HTML Colour Codes, there are plenty of websites on this.

Once you've filled in the appropriate information in the Create Tag prompt, click on **Save Changes** to add the new tag.

### Moving the Tag between Primary, and Secondary tags

By default, new tags created will be **Secondary Tags** also known as **Sub Categories**, sometimes you'll want these to be primary tags, to do this, click and drag the tag to the **Primary** slot at the top, follow the below animation to see how this is done:

### Editing a Tag

Made a mistake, or need to change something on a tag? follow the same procedure as above in **Deleting a Tag** until you get to the editing prompt, this time, **DON'T** click on Delete Tag, instead edit the information displayed until you are happy, then click **Save Changes**. Easy as that!
