## User Handbook
### A glossary of terms used in the documentation, and their explanation

This part of the document is to give you a better understanding of what certain terms said throughout the documentation mean. You can refer to this at any time you are uncertain of anything.

**_Discussion_**

This is a brand new 'thread' or 'discussion' which creates the initial post for people to reply to.

**_Post_**

A post is found at the very start of a discussion, and also any subsequent replies users make. A post is the content that you as a user write in contribution to a particular discussion or thread.

**_Mention_**

Mentions are a way of publically alerting another user to the discussion or post, a mention is used by:
@username
for example, if someone wanted to mention me (Arkinn) to a post, they would simply type @arkinn **anywhere** in their post (content can also be added as well), once submitted I would get a notification of the mention immediately.

**_Post Menu_**

The Post Menu is a small list of tools that can be used to edit, flag, reply to, like, delete, restore and permanently delete a post.

**_Thread Menu_**

The Thread Menu is similar to the Post Menu, although is designed specifically for use with threads/discussions. The tools allow for lock/unlock, sticky/unsticky, deleting, follow/unfollow, rename and edit tags.
