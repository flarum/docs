# Quy tắc ứng xử

### _Welcome to the Flarum Community!_

... And thanks for joining us! We're excited about Flarum, and are always happy to meet people who feel the same way. We want *everyone* to get the most out of Flarum and the Flarum community, so we ask that you please read and follow these guidelines. These apply whether you're using our forum, Discord chat, communicating on GitHub, or any other form of communication without the Flarum community.

### Trên tất cả, hãy trở nên tuyệt vời!

We're all here to talk about Flarum, and to work together toward making it an even better application. Criticizing ideas (by means of reasoned arguments, of course) is an important part of that. But let's not get carried away and devolve into personal attacks, because negativity only gets in the way. We ask that you avoid the following:

- Ngôn ngữ xúc phạm hoặc lăng mạ, cũng như bất kỳ loại ngôn từ kích động thù địch nào
- Các bài đăng nhằm quấy rối, mạo danh hoặc bôi nhọ người khác
- Xóa nội dung đã đăng không cần thiết
- Cố gắng lạm dụng hoặc tiết lộ thông tin cá nhân của người khác
- Nội dung khiêu dâm hoặc khiêu dâm
- Thư rác, bài đăng lừa đảo và bất kỳ hành động nào nhằm làm xấu mặt trang web này
- Discussion of software piracy and similar topics

*All the above are grounds for moderator action.* If you have an issue with another member, we ask that you please don't confront them yourself. If it's on the forum, please use the *Report* command on the post in question, then leave it up to the staff to deal with the situation. Otherwise, report the violation to [admin@flarum.org](mailto:admin@flarum.org).

Our moderators may edit or delete any content that is offensive or disruptive to the flow of communication. Serious or repeated offenses may lead to suspension of the offending user's account. So, you know, *be cool*. 😎

### Hãy tự nghe

Want to start a new discussion? First, be sure to read [our FAQ](faq.md) and follow the links to make sure you're fully informed about the project. Then spend some time browsing the forum, familiarize yourself with [the tag system](https://discuss.flarum.org/tags), and do a few searches for keywords related to your topic: *it could be someone has already started a discussion about it!*

When you're sure you're ready to start a discussion, please keep the following points in mind:

- Give it a good title! You'll get the best results if your title makes it clear what you want to talk about.
- Choose the right tag(s). This will increase the likelihood your post will be read and answered promptly.
- * Đừng * đăng nhiều lần về cùng một chủ đề, vì làm như vậy sẽ có tác dụng ngược lại.
- If not using a tag set aside for multilingual use, *post in English only.* We can't help if we can't read you!
- Remember, you don't need to sign your posts. We've got your profile to let us know who you are.

Please make the effort to help us keep things organized. Time spent tidying up is time that we can't spend getting to know you, discussing your issues, and talking about Flarum. And that, after all, is what we're all here to do!

### Thực hiện đếm câu trả lời của bạn

You're taking the time to participate in a discussion, in the hope that others will read your ideas and take them into consideration. So why not make the effort to make your reply worth reading?

- Don't reply to a title. Take some time to *read* the OP, and at least *scan* the rest of the conversation first.
- Ask yourself if your reply adds to the discussion. If it doesn't, give it some more thought before posting.
- Tránh đưa ra những bài viết dài một từ chỉ để đồng ý với ai đó; bạn có thể sử dụng nút "Thích" cho việc đó.
- Avoid making multiple posts in a row when one would suffice. This is a forum, not a chat room.
- Nếu câu trả lời của bạn có khả năng làm chuyển hướng tiến trình của cuộc thảo luận, thay vào đó hãy cân nhắc bắt đầu một cuộc thảo luận mới.
- Nếu bạn chỉ muốn đăng một chút vô nghĩa như một bài kiểm tra, hãy làm điều đó trong thẻ [Đăng bài kiểm tra](https://discuss.flarum.org/t/sandbox).
- Đảm bảo rằng câu trả lời của bạn cung cấp phản hồi và hỗ trợ mang tính xây dựng để tạo ra một cộng đồng hòa nhập.

No one's going to complain about the occasional joke or smart remark. We like to keep the mood light! But to keep things productive, as well, we ask that you try to avoid derailing a discussion altogether.
