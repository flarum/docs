Webeindustry for his help in the server install guides, his many hours spent helping me perfect the installation method we used for Flarum. A huge thanks to him.

Kulga for his help in the method of creating animated gif's that have been used numerous times in the user handbook. Again a huge thanks to him.

I will update this page as and when others contribute to the documentation writing process.
