## Locking a Discussion

To lock a discussion, as always you'll first need to find the discussion in the discussions list, once you have gone ahead and bring up the thread menu by hovering the mouse over the right of the thread, and selecting the discussion menu, as shown in the screenshot below:

With the menu, click on the **Lock** label which will immediately lock the thread, preventing any further replies (Note that people who have **permission** to lock discussions can also reply discussions if they are locked).

A confirmation of the thread lock will be a padlock over the user's avatar as shown below:
