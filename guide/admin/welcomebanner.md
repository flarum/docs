### Editing the Welcome Banner

The Welcome Banner is one of the first things you forum guests, members, moderators, and admins will see. From a fresh installation, it is the text situated inside the large grey strip at the top of the page.

If you do not see the banner, it may be because you have clicked on the "X" to close it, to restore it, you can either move to a new browser (or system) or clear your cookies.

Changing the welcome banner of your forum instance requires you to be in the Administrator Control Panel, you can do this by clicking your username to the top right of your screen, and then clicking **Administration**. The example below will show you how this is done:

Once you are in the Administration Panel, you'll see some navigation tabs flowing down the left-hand side, click on **Basics** to reveal the configuration page to the right-hand side.

On the configuration page, you'll see **Welcome Banner** as the last option on that page, underneath will be **2** text boxes, one for the forum title, and one for the subheading.

By default, the title says "Welcome to Flarum"
And by default, the subheading says "This is beta software and you should not use it in production."

Make the necessary edits that you feel are necessary to those 2 fields then click **Save Changes** to save your new welcome banner.
