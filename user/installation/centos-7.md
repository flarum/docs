## BETA Software

Please keep in mind that Flarum is beta software. That means:

   - It still has some incomplete features and bugs üêõüêû and
   - At some point ‚Äì sooner or later ‚Äì it will probably break! üí•

Beta is all about fixing these issues and improving Flarum. We‚Äôre busy working hard to make Flarum better, so we ask that you:

   - **Don‚Äôt use it in production.** We can‚Äôt support you if things go awry. And upgrading to subsequent versions might involve getting your hands dirty.
   - **Report bugs responsibly.** Poorly written bug reports take time to deal with, distracting us from adding new features and making Flarum stable.

Before you install, please read our Contributing guide so you will know what you‚Äôre signing up for!

## Installing from scratch on CentOS 7

### Some important notes before we begin:

  - Following this tutorial will **disable the firewall, and SELinux**

Whilst this is **not** ideal for a server environment, we do this for ease of use, and to get you through the installation, so, for now, you will be responsible for setting up your own security measures.

  - This guide has been extensively tested on CentOS 7.3 1611, if you use a different version to this, your mileage may vary!

### Disable SELinux & Stop the Firewall
```
setenforce 0
systemctl disable firewalld.service
systemctl stop firewalld.service
```

### Install Dependancies
```
rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh https://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el7/webtatic-release.rpm
rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-9.noarch.rpm
yum -y update
yum install -y nginx php71w-{cli,curl,mbstring,openssl,json,pdo_mysql,gd,dom,fpm} mysql-server unzip
```

### Install Composer

Flarum uses Composer to install & manage its dependencies.

See https://discuss.flarum.org/d/9225-the-most-unsettling-end-user-guide-to-composer-for-flarum for a user guide to using Composer

Run the following commands to install composer:
```sh
curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer.phar
sudo php composer.phar --install-dir=/usr/bin --filename composer
rm composer.phar
```

### Configure PHP-FPM

nano /etc/php-fpm.d/ww&#8203;w.conf

Find & Replace:
```
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
listen = /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock

;listen.owner = nodody
listen.owner = nginx

;listen.group = nobody
listen.group = nginx

;listen.mode = 0660
listen.mode = 0660
```

Run `nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/flarum.conf`, then type the following.

Make sure you replace `{domain-name-here}` with your domain.

```
server {
    listen       80;

    # IMPORTANT: change this
    server_name  {domain-name-here};
    root         /usr/share/nginx/flarum;
