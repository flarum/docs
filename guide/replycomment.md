## User Handbook
### Replying to a persons post

This particular method is used for when you wish to reply to a comment made by someone else, this will automatically create a tie to their reply and will notify the person that their comment has recieved a response (Depending on their personal preference settings) in case they wish to in turn respond to you.

To do this:

- Hover to the bottom of their post to bring up the **Reply** link
- Once the reply box displays, type your desired response to the thread.
- Click on the **Post Reply** button at the bottom left of the box.

Again, once you've done this, your comment will go almost immediately live for all to view, and a notification (if they have allowed) will be immediately sent to their notification area.
