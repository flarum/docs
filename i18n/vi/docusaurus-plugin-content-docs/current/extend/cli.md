# Flarum CLI

The Flarum development ecosystem is oriented around many small, modules, interacting extensions. This is a very powerful and flexible paradigm, but it also brings the maintenance cost of creating and maintaining all these extensions.

We've created the Flarum CLI (command line interface) as a tool to help developers by automating some repetitive and menial tasks, and allow them to get into the actual work without much hassle.

Major updates about Flarum CLI will be published [on this discussion](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/28427-flarum-cli-v10).

See the [package's readme](https://github.com/flarum/cli#readme) for information on:

- Cài đặt
- Usage
- Upgrading
- Available commands
- Some implementation details, if you're interested
