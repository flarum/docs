### Deleting a Users Post

Deleting a post made by someone else is easy, but has 2 stages, which are outlined in detail below.

As always, firstly you'll want to find the post that needs deleting. Once you have, hover your mouse to the right, lower side of the post area  to bring up the post menu, once it appears, you'll see three dots, and a background, click on that and then click **Delete**.

Be aware though, clicking **Delete** will only soft-delete the post, meaning for now, the post will remain there in non-live state. This gives you the opportunity to restore the post should you think you have made a mistake, or want another mod to review it, etc.

The option to Delete looks like this:

To permanently delete the post, once you are **sure you want it removing** then go ahead and expand the post, by clicking on the three dots next to the username of the poster (screenshot below, top left), once the post is expanded, do the same as you did in the last step, click on the bottom right three dots, this will being up the option to **Delete Forever**.

Once you've clicked on **Delete Forever** the post will be permanently removed from the database.
