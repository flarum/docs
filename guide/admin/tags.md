### Create Tag Components

#### Name:

The name is what you'd like the tag to be called, also known as the category title.

#### Slug:

The slug is a string that goes into the URL, essentially it's a version of the name of the tag that is all lower-case, and uses dashes instead of spaces.

Unless you need to, you generally don't need to do anything with this, as when you type in the **Name** the slug auto-fills in.

#### Description:

The description of the tag will appear alongside the **name** in the tag selection post when making a post, it's a short few words giving a more in-depth description of the category it belongs to.

#### Color:

This is the color you would like the tag to appear in on the posts, and forums, the color box uses **HTML Color Codes** beginning with a **#** you can Google around for HTML Color Codes, there are plenty of websites on this.

Once you've filled in the appropriate information in the Create Tag prompt, click on **Save Changes** to add the new tag.
