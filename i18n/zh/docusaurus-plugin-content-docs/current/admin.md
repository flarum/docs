# 后台管理面板

Flarum 管理面板是一个友好的论坛管理界面。 且只对「管理组」成员可见。 点击论坛右上角您的 **用户名**, 选择 **后台管理** 即可进入管理面板。

管理员控制面板有如下部分，具体是：
- **Dashboard** - Shows the main Admin Dashboard, containing statistics and other relevant information.
- **Basics** - Shows the options to set basic forum details such as Name, Description, and Welcome Banner.
- **Email** - Allows you to configure your E-Mail settings. Refer [here](https://docs.flarum.org/mail) for more information.
- **Permissions** - Shows the permissions for each user group, and allows you to configure global and specific scopes.
- **Appearance** - Allows you to customize the forum's colors, branding and add additional CSS for customization.
- **Users** - Provides you with a paginated list of all the users in the forum, and grants you the ability to edit the user or take administrative actions.

Apart from the above mentioned sections, the Admin Dashboard also allows you to manage your Extensions (including the flarum core extensions such as Tags) under the _Features_ section. Extensions which modify the forum theme, or allow you to use multiple languages are categorized under the _Themes_ and _Languages_ section respectively.
