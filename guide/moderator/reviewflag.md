## User Handbook

### Reviewing Flagged Content as a Moderator

As a Moderator, no doubt at some point through your journey your users will come across content that is not appropriate, off topic, spam etc. Flarum has an incredibly simple tool to deal with this, which we will outline in much greater detail in this document.

### (( Documentation Note: The below 2 screenshots could do with replacing with an animation, it will look much tidier and give a better impression ))

The screenshot below will show you what happens, and what you should expect to see when content is flagged for review:

So, you click on the flag message, and it will bring you to the post in question, similar to the below screenshot:

Pretty hard to miss, right?

From here you can do 1 of 2 things.

 - Delete the Post

Is the content truly requiring mod action? then go ahead and delete the post! just be warned that this option will only **soft-delete** the post for now (we'll show you how to permanently delete it below shortly).

 - Dismiss the Flag

Don't agree that this content needs any action? then just go ahead and **Dismiss the Flag** this will then _cancel_ the report, and act as if nothing ever happened. (literally!)

### Deleting the Content

Alright! so you've soft-deleted the post, that's cool but it's still there. Not to worry though, we're going to go ahead and delete that pesky post from the entire interweb! - well maybe not the _whole_ internet, but certainly our forum!

Firstly, you need to go to the post location (If you're not already there), after the username, and post time you'll see 3 dots (...) with a background. Go ahead and click on that, which will bring the post back to full view again, not for long though! as at the bottom right of the post space, there will be another 3 dots, with a background, click on that and you'll be presented with 2 options.

 - Restore

Made an error the first time, and don't think the post needed deleting? no problem, click Restore and it will be put straight back.

 - Delete Forever

Definitely sure this needs to go? then click this button, and the post will vanish from the site. Just be warned though, that if you chose this option, there's no going back!
