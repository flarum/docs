## Hedefler

Flarum, [esoTalk](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk) ve [FluxBB](https://fluxbb.org)'nin birleşik halefidir. Şu şekilde tasarlanmıştır:

* **Hızlı ve basit.** Dağınıklık yok, şişkinlik yok, karmaşık bağımlılıklar yok. Flarum PHP ile oluşturulmuştur, bu nedenle dağıtımı hızlı ve kolaydır. Arayüz, küçük bir ayak izine sahip, performanslı bir JavaScript çerçevesi olan [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org) tarafından desteklenmektedir.

* **Güzel ve duyarlı.** Bu, insanlar için forum yazılımıdır. Flarum, kutudan çıkar çıkmaz tüm platformlarda tutarlı ve sezgisel olacak şekilde dikkatle tasarlanmıştır.

* **Güçlü ve genişletilebilir.** Flarum'u topluluğunuza uyacak şekilde özelleştirin, genişletin ve entegre edin. Flarum’un mimarisi, [Güçlü Uzantı API'si](/extend/) ile inanılmaz derecede esnektir.

* **Ücretsiz ve açıktır.** Flarum, [MIT lisansı](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/blob/master/LICENSE) altında yayınlanmıştır.
