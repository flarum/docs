## User Handbook
### Searching the Forum

Flarum has a powerful, easy to use forum search feature, to which you can search for post content, users and mentions.

At the top of your screen, you'll see a box with **Search** written inside, you'll notice that this will do a search for discussions **AND** users all in the same box when you type.

## Using the Search Box

In the below examples, we are going to use the search term 'free' and will be demonstrating how this looks and how to to look for both post content, and a users profile.
The screenshot below will show what happens when we have entered our search term, and the results displayed:

You'lll notice that the search system has done a search for both _content_ **AND** _users_ pretty cool, right?

### Selecting the user's profile

When you've clicked on the user's profile (I've done this from the search box above) you'll be presented with the users profile where you can view their posts, any discussions they've started or contributed to and also any times they have been mentioned on the forums. You can find a much more about this in the [Your Profile](profile.md) page.

### Selecting a post from the results

Once you've seen something that takes your interest, or you've found the post you were looking for, go ahead and click the result from the search box which will display the discussion your post was found on. In the example below, I selected the first result from our search a little earlier.

#### But wait, what happens if I can't find any posts of interest, or the one I'm looking for? 3 discussion is not enough!

Well you are in luck! take another look at the search box (first screenshot), you'll see "Search all discussions for" clicking this will allow you see many more discussions and posts based on the search term you provided. To see what this looks like, see the screenshot below:
