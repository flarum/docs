### Editing the Welcome Banner

The Welcome Banner is one of the first thing you forum guests, members, moderators and admins will see. From a fresh installation, it is the text situated inside the large grey strip at the top of the page.

Changing the welcome banner of your forum instance requires you to be in the Administrator Control Panel, you can do this by clicking your username to the top right of your screen, and then clicking Administration. The example below will show you how this is done:

Once you are in the Administration Panel, you'll see some navigation tabs flowing down the left hand side, click on Basics to reveal the configuration page to the right hand side.

On the configuration page, you'll see **Welcome Banner** as the last option on that page, underneath will be **2** text boxes, one for the forum title, and one for subheading.

By default the title says "Welcome to Flarum"
And by default the subheading says "This is beta software and you should not use it in production."

Once you've changed those 2 boxes to be appropriate for your forum, click **Save Changes** to make those edits immediately live on your forum instance.
