### Assign permissions to User Groups

To assign a permission set to a User Group this requires you to be in the Administrator Control Panel, you can do this by clicking your username to the top right of your screen, and then clicking **Administration**. The example below will show you how this is done:

Once you are in the Administration Panel, you'll see some navigation tabs flowing down the left-hand side, click on **Permissions** to reveal the configuration page to the right-hand side.

On the configuration page, you'll see a number of different permissions that can be applied to user groups, both pre-created on the initial install and to user groups that you create, as shown below:

In this guide, we're going to use the user group that we created in [Create/Modify/Delete](usergroups.md) called **Staff Member** and apply the appropriate permissions to that group.

### Assigning permissions to a User Group

To start off with, it's crucial that you know which user group should receive which permission, it's a good idea to have this mapped out beforehand, as it will help invaluable later on.

As you'll see in the animation below, simply select the permission, and then select the target user group on the drop-down menu - simple!

You'll need to repeat that process for each permission you wish to assign.

### Removing permissions from a User Group

To remove the permission assigned, follow the same procedure above, this time you'll be clicking the user group to **remove** it from the permission, see below for an example:
