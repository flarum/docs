# Installation

If you already have a webserver set up with all the works (Webserver, PHP, MySQL) or are using a shared host, see the [general installation instructions](/user/installation/general.md). If you have a brand new server (with root access), you can follow these instructions depending on OS:

- [CentOS 7](centos-7.md)
- [Ubuntu Server 16.04](ubuntu-server.md)
