### Settings

The Settings page allows you to configure certain preferences on your profile, you may change your registered e-mail address and password on this page. You can also set your preference on how you wish to be notified about certain events in Flarum, for example you can set if you wish to be notified by email and/or in the notification area if someone replies to your post. There are many other options available for you to see, take a look at the screenshot below to see what Flarum can do for you!

#### Notification Key

 - The **Red "X"** means that the event selected will **NOT** trigger a notification.
 - The **Green Tick** means that the event selected **WILL** trigger a notification.
 - The **Grey "X"** means that the event **CANNOT** be triggered at this time.
 
You are able to change this at any time simply by clicking on which event you wish to use, for example, if you wanted to receive an email whenever someone mentions you with the @ symbol in the forums, then **clicking that icon** making sure it is a **Green Tick** will activate that setting. Each time you click an icon, it will automatically save that preference for you.
