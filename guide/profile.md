## User Handbook
### Your Profile

Flarum has a basic profile system, in your profile, there are 3 different sections of your profile that you can view.

 - Posts
 - Discussions
 - Mentions

## Sections Explained

You can be taken straight to any of the posts, or discussions explained in this section by clicking on the result of each of the sections. Your Posts, Discussions, and Mentions sections are available for the public to view when they visit your profile, however, they will only show what those users have access to.

### Posts
The Posts tab will allow you to see a 'Timeline view' of posts that you have made in any discussion you have access to, the most recent posts you have made will appear at the top, whilst the older posts will be descending.
You can see an example of how they look in the screenshot below:

### Discussions
The Discussions tab will allow you to see what discussions you have started. The order they appear in is the same as **Posts**, the most recent at the top.

### Settings

The Settings page allows you to configure certain preferences on your profile which are only visible to you, the user, you may change your registered e-mail address and password on this page. You can also set your preference on how you wish to be notified about certain events in Flarum, for example, you can set if you wish to be notified by email and/or in the notification area if someone replies to your post. There are many other options available for you to see, take a look at the screenshot below to see what Flarum can do for you!

#### Notification Key

 - The **Red "X"** means that the event selected will **NOT** trigger a notification.
 - The **Green Tick** means that the event selected **WILL** trigger a notification.
 - The **Grey "X"** means that the event **CANNOT** be triggered at this time.

You are able to change this at any time simply by clicking on which event you wish to use, for example, if you wanted to receive an email whenever someone mentions you with the @ symbol in the forums, then **clicking that icon** making sure it is a **Green Tick** will activate that setting. Each time you click an icon, it will automatically save that preference for you.
