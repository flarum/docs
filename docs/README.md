# About Flarum

Flarum is a delightfully simple discussion platform for your website. It's fast and easy to use, with all the features you need to run a successful community.

This user guide will help you to set up your own forum using Flarum and teach you the basics of managing your community.

## Goals

Flarum is the combined successor of [esoTalk](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk) and [FluxBB](https://fluxbb.org). It is designed to be:

* **Fast and simple.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. Flarum is built with PHP so it’s quick and easy to deploy. The interface is powered by [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org), a performant JavaScript framework with a tiny footprint.

* **Beautiful and responsive.** This is forum software for humans. Flarum is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive across platforms, out-of-the-box.

* **Powerful and extensible.** Customize, extend, and integrate Flarum to suit your community. Flarum’s architecture is amazingly flexible, with a [powerful Extension API](https://github.com/flarum/docs/tree/master/docs/extend).

* **Free and open.** Flarum is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/blob/master/LICENSE).
