# Other Ways to Help

## Add Documentation

Adding documentation can help countless future Flarum users. A few ideas of what to work on:

- User guides to help Flarum end users with some advanced Flarum features.
- More [frequently asked questions](faq.md).
- Expanded [troubleshooting](troubleshoot.md) steps.
- Step-by-step tutorials for Flarum development or installation. 
- [Technical reference guides](extend/README.md) for extension developers.
- Improving literally anything else you think we should elaborate on or explain better.

A good way to find topics to write about is to look for common questions in the [support tag](https://discuss.flarum.org/t/support) of our community.

## Report Issues

If there's a bug that's bothering you, or a feature idea on your mind, we can't know about it unless you tell us! We track bugs, suggestions, and future development plans [via GitHub issues](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues). If there's already an issue open, adding likes and (constructive) additional information can be very helpful!

## Translate Flarum

We want Flarum to be accessible to everyone, regardless of language! By contributing translations, you make it possible for many more people to enjoy Flarum. Best of all, we use user-friendly GUIs for translations, so no technical skills are necessary to help!

Translations for Flarum core, bundled extensions, and community extensions are managed through [weblate](https://weblate.rob006.net/projects/flarum/). Translations for this documentation are managed through [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/flarum-docs).


The Flarum Foundation has created the "flarum-lang" organization to support translators and ensure continuous availability of language packs. You can learn more about this by [visiting the GitHub repository](https://github.com/flarum-lang/about). If you want to support an existing language pack, start a new translation, or you run into issues using weblate or crowdin, it's best to [get in touch with the `flarum-lang` team](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/27519-the-flarum-language-project).

## Write an Extension

If there's a feature you're missing, or a theme idea you have, [writing a custom extension](extend/README.md) will make Flarum that much better for you and others.

## Join our Community

Join [our community](https://discuss.flarum.org) to talk about Flarum development, get help with your instance, or just meet cool people! If you're experienced with Flarum, you can also help out beginners!

## Donate to Flarum

The Flarum Foundation doesn't make money off of Flarum, but do have bills to pay. Donations via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/flarum) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/flarum) are always gratefully received. In the past, we've also been able to support some of our core developers financially, so they could work on Flarum part time. This couldn't be possible without your financial support.

## Spread the Word!

If you like Flarum, please consider blogging/tweeting/talking about it! More people aware of Flarum leads to more people engaged with Flarum, and therefore more activity, better extensions, and faster development.
