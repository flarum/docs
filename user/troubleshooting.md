## Troubleshooting

If you’re having a problem installing Flarum, check out the [Installation tag](http://discuss.flarum.org/t/installation) on the support forum. Someone might’ve had the same problem as you! If not, start a discussion and we’ll do our best to help.

Also, you can try enabling debug mode on your flarum site, to help you figure out what the problem is. Open up your flarum directory in the file browser of your choice. Open the config.php file with your favorite text editor. Find the line that says debug (near the top) and change it from false to true. Once completed, browse to your flarum installation and it should give you troubleshooting help on the error.

Once you have done this, you can try to resolve this error yourself, or start a new discussion and list the error that you are having.
