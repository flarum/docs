## User Handbook

### Sticky/Unsticky a thread

Please note: this guide **Requires** the **Sticky Extension** to be **Enabled** (which it is by default) otherwise this guide will not function as intended.

A sticky thread means that the discussion will remain at the top of the all discussion list until a user has read all the posts contained in the discussion, once they are all read, the discussion will disappear from the top of the list until a new reply is made.

Sticky threads will always, however, remain at the top of their tag's discussion list, regardless of if all discussions contained inside are read or not.

To either Sticky or unsticky a thread, hover your mouse over the right side of the thread, which will bring up the three dots, click that to reveal the thread menu. As shown below in the menu, go ahead and click on **Sticky** which will attach a Pin to the thread, and force it to remain at the top of the homepage.

To reverse the Sticky, follow the same instructions as above this time you'll be clicking **Unsticky**

 - A thread **with** the Sticky attribute applied will look like the screenshot below:
