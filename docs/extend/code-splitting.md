# Code Splitting

## Introduction

Code splitting is a technique used to reduce the size of your bundle by splitting your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. This results in smaller bundles which leads to faster load time. Flarum instances can have a lot of extensions installed, and when each extension lazy loads the modules it does not immediately or frequently need, the initial load time of the forum can be significantly reduced. The opposite leads to a bloated bundle and a slow initial load time.

## How to Split Your Code

If you wish to split (lazy load) a module, you can use the asynchronous `import()` function. This function returns a promise which resolves to the module you are importing. Webpack will automatically split the module into a separate chunk file which will be loaded on demand.

```js
import('acme/forum/components/CustomPage').then(({ default: CustomPage }) => {
  // do something with CustomPage
});
```

This will create a chunk file under `js/dist/forum/components/CustomPage.js`. This chunk file will be loaded when the import is called. But before that can happen, the backend needs to be made aware of this chunk file. You do that by adding the `js/dist/forum` path as a source for the `forum` frontend. *(If the chunk was under `js/dist/admin`, you would add it as a source for the `admin` frontend, same for `js/dist/common` and `common`.)*

In `extend.php`:

```php
use Flarum\Extend;

return [
    (new Extend\Frontend('forum'))
        ->jsDirectory(__DIR__.'/js/dist/forum'),
];
```

## Importing split modules from core or other extensions

Flarum by default lazy loads certain modules of its own, such as the `LogInModal` component. If you need to import one of these modules, you can do so by just asynchronously importing it as you would any other module.

```js
import('flarum/forum/components/LogInModal').then(({ default: LogInModal }) => {
  // do something with LogInModal
});
```

For modules from other extensions, you can import them using the `ext:` syntax.

```js
import('ext:flarum/tags/common/components/TagSelectionModal').then(({ default: TagSelectionModal }) => {
  // do something with CustomPage
});
```

## Extending split modules

If you wish to extend a split module, rather than passing the prototype to `extend` or `override`, you can pass the import path as a first argument. The callback will be executed when the module is loaded. Checkout [Changing The UI Part 3](./frontend#changing-the-ui-part-3) for more details.

## Code APIs that support lazy loading

The following code APIs support lazy loading:

### Async Modals

You can pass a callback that returns a promise to `app.modal.show`. The modal will be shown when the promise resolves.

```js
app.modal.show(() => import('flarum/forum/components/LogInModal'));
```

### Async Pages

You can pass a callback that returns a promise when declaring the page component.

```js
import Extend from 'flarum/common/extenders';

export default [
  new Extend.Routes()
    .add('acme', '/acme', () => import('./components/CustomPage')),
];
```

### Flarum Lazy Loaded Modules

You can see a list of all the modules that are lazy loaded by Flarum in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/flarum/framework/tree/2.x/framework/core/js/dist).
