# Identifying errors

1. Did you enable debug in your `config.php` file?
2. Does the page show any console errors:
  - In Google Chrome right click - inspect element - console tab.

# Issue reporting

Our preferred communication channel for bugs is through [Github](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues).

Bug reports offer helpful information for our developers to quickly analyze the root cause, including:

- The version of Flarum you have installed.
- Any web server information you have, like Apache/Nginx and the PHP version.
- The URL to your website, so we can see the bug for ourselves.
- Whether you are using a shared hosting environment or have/manage your own server.
- A list of the extensions you've installed or the composer.json file.
- Any logs you think will help us in finding the root cause.
