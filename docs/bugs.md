Thank you for helping us test Flarum. We're happy to have you on the team! We need people who can *troubleshoot issues patiently* and *communicate them clearly*. As you probably know, good bug reporting takes some time and effort. If you're fine with that, then let's get started!

## Duplicates

Found a bug already? Wonderful! We'd love to hear about it &mdash; but first you should check around to make sure you're not wasting your time on a known issue:

- Search our [Support forum](http://discuss.flarum.org/t/support) to see if it's already been reported.
- We could be working on a fix, so search our [issue tracker](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues) too.

If you've searched *thoroughly* and come up empty-handed, we'll welcome your report. If it's just a simple issue (a misspelled word or graphics glitch, for example) skip to the next paragraph. But if you're seeing errors, or something is clearly broken, we'll need you to gather some information first. Please head over to our [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot.md) guide and follow the instructions there. Collect as much info as you can!

## Reporting

We track issues on GitHub. Make sure you open your issue in the [correct repository](https://github.com/flarum), and fill out all of the information in the Bug Report template.

If you can, check if the issue is reproducible with the latest version of Flarum. If you are using a pre-release or development version, please indicate the specific version you are using.

Remember: the goal of a bug report is to make it easy for us to replicate the bug and fix it. You might want to read [this article](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) for some useful tips on how to write an effective bug report. It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear reprduction steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "needs verification" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

Once you've posted your report, we'd ask that you please *follow the discussion* and wait patiently. We may need to ask for further details or clarification; but we've always got plenty to do, and it could be a while before we can give your report the time it deserves.
